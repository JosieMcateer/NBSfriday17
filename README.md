# What was the challenge?
the challenge was to create a plan for a large cinema. using epic stories, user stories, estimations and listing in priority order. 
Users, Admin and Staff Members had different requirements so we had to do 3 epic stories and break these down for each. 
We had to include accetance criteria and the DoD (definition of done).

Once completed we have to use GIT to commit and push these into our repository. 

Then we had to add a ReadMe.md file and edit this with the questions (hopefully) in bold. 

# How I expected the challenge to go
I expected the challenge would be ok- i have used GIT in the past and i have done many course on agile however i have never had to do epic stories, user stories etc in the format.
I thought it would be a quick challenge (it wasn't)

# What went well?
Using GIT went well, i used it mainly for practice and committed often so that i wouldnt loose my work. I had to use the VM for the command line. 

Once i knew what i was doing with the stories etc I worked through them and understood them more.

# What didn't go as planned?
At first the format in which i was writing my user stories and acceptance criteria wasn't right. 

As i was slightly confused i asked Piers, and now have learnt from the mistake and have fixed it

When Piers first explained i had to ask for more info and he sent an example, as soon as I had this it made sense. 

I struggled with the "Admin" user stories as i was confused on what ther job was. 

We were told this would be 2 hours but took a lot longer than this- mainly as i did make mistakes/wasnt happy enough with it and kept revisiting.

# improvements for the future
In the future, before starting a task i will read QA community to refresh my knowledge andto ensure i am doing it correctly.

Also i will continue to ask if I am ever confused. :)
