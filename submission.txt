EPICS: Priority:

admin epic
user epic
staff member epic

I have ranked it as these as the admin behind the sight is the most important, 
without this there wouldn`t be a correct sight for the users.
Also i have put the user sight as second as staff could always help the members
by directing them to this sight.
